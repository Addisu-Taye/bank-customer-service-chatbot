# This function is now used by doc_loader.py to load documents.
# It is kept here as a helper for clarity, but the primary loading logic is in doc_loader.py
# (It was originally here in the prompt's utils/vector_builder.py, so keeping it
# might be confusing. Let's remove it from here and ensure doc_loader.py handles it.)
# Rationale: The original vector_builder.py had 'load_documents(source_folder)'.
# My doc_loader.py now has 'load_documents_from_folder'.
# To avoid redundancy and circular imports, doc_loader.py will be responsible for loading.
# So, no need for load_documents here.
