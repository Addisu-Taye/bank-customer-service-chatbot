üè¶ Bank Customer Service Chatbot
A vector-based chatbot system for bank customer service built using LangChain and HuggingFace embeddings. This project now dynamically loads its knowledge base from a GitHub Release, processes documents into vector embeddings, and uses a FAISS vector database for fast semantic search and chatbot interaction.

‚ú® Features
üìÑ Multi-format Document Loading: Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT files using langchain_unstructured loaders for building the knowledge base.
üß† Financial-Domain Vector Store: Converts documents into embeddings using FinLang/finance-embeddings-investopedia for enhanced financial understanding. The FAISS vector database is then saved and can be dynamically downloaded by the Streamlit app.
üåê Self-Contained Deployment: The Streamlit application can download and prepare the necessary FAISS vector database at runtime, making deployment easier.
üó£Ô∏è Enhanced Conversational AI: The chatbot now understands common greetings ("Hello," "Hi") and appreciative phrases ("Thank you," "Thanks"), providing natural and friendly responses before diving into banking-specific queries.
‚öôÔ∏è Extensible Utility Functions: Modular structure for easy updates and extension of the core components.
‚úÖ Clean Error Handling: Skips problematic files and logs loading issues during document processing, and handles runtime errors gracefully.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Addisu-Taye/bank-customer-service-chatbot.git
cd bank-customer-service-chatbot
Create and Activate Virtual Environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:
Install the core libraries for LangChain, HuggingFace, FAISS, Streamlit, and document parsing. It's recommended to install torch first for GPU support if available, then the others.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install torch # Or tensorflow if preferred. For GPU, check PyTorch/TensorFlow docs.
pip install faiss-cpu # Use faiss-gpu if you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU
pip install textblob
python -m textblob.download_corpora # Download TextBlob's necessary data
Note: Ensure your requirements.txt includes essential packages like langchain, langchain-community, langchain-huggingface, transformers, streamlit, unstructured, pdfminer.six, pypdf, etc. If not, add them or install them individually. For example:

Bash

pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-huggingface transformers streamlit
pip install "unstructured[pdf]" # For PDF support
pip install pypdf # Often required for PDF processing alongside unstructured
üöÄ Usage
Step 1: Prepare Your Documents & Generate Vector Database
Place your bank-related documents (PDFs, Word files, TXT files) in the bank_docs/ folder.

Then, use the vector_builder.py script to create your FAISS vector database. This will use the FinLang/finance-embeddings-investopedia model as configured in utils/embedder.py.

Bash

python -c "from utils.vector_builder import save_vector_db; save_vector_db('bank_docs', 'vectors')"
This command will:

Load all supported documents from bank_docs/.
Generate vector embeddings using the model specified in utils/embedder.py.
Save the FAISS index files (e.g., index.faiss, index.pkl) to the vectors/ directory.
Step 2: Upload Your vectors.zip to GitHub Releases
For seamless deployment, the app.py is configured to download the vectors folder from a remote URL.

Create vectors.zip: Zip the vectors/ folder that was just generated. Ensure that index.faiss and index.pkl are at the root level of your vectors.zip archive.
Example (Linux/macOS): zip -r vectors.zip vectors/ (if index.faiss and index.pkl are directly inside vectors/)
Example (Windows): Right-click the vectors folder -> Send to -> Compressed (zipped) folder. Rename to vectors.zip.
Create a GitHub Release: Go to your GitHub repository on the web, navigate to the "Releases" section, and "Draft a new release."
Upload vectors.zip as an Asset: In the release drafting page, under the "Assets" section, upload your vectors.zip file.
Publish Release: Publish the release.
Copy Direct Download URL: After publishing, right-click on the vectors.zip asset link and select "Copy link address." This URL will be used in app.py.
Step 3: Configure app.py and Environment
Update GITHUB_RELEASES_ZIP_URL in app.py: Open app.py and replace "YOUR_DIRECT_GITHUB_RELEASES_ZIP_URL_HERE" with the URL you copied in Step 2.
Set Hugging Face API Token:
Local: Create a .env file in your project root with HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="your_token_here".
Deployment: Configure HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN as a secret/environment variable in your deployment platform's settings (e.g., Streamlit Community Cloud secrets).
Step 4: Run the Chatbot Application
Start the Streamlit application to interact with your bank customer service chatbot:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
üõ† Notes and Troubleshooting
Dynamic Download: The first time app.py runs (or if the vectors/ folder is missing/incomplete), it will attempt to download and extract vectors.zip from the specified URL. This might take a moment.
PDF Errors? Ensure unstructured[pdf], pdfminer.six, and pypdf are installed.
Deprecation Warnings? This project uses recent langchain and langchain-unstructured versions, which might occasionally show warnings.
File Skipping? Invalid or unsupported files are skipped with warnings during document loading.
Model Download: The first time you run the chatbot, the specified embedding model (FinLang/finance-embeddings-investopedia) and the large language model (google/flan-t5-large) will be downloaded by Hugging Face Transformers. This may take some time depending on your internet connection.
Conversational Greetings: The chatbot is now pre-programmed to respond to common greetings and thanks before engaging the RAG pipeline.
